I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota, advised by [Prof. Volkan Isler](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isler/).

My research interests mainly lie in computer vision and robotics. 


I hold a M.S. in [Computer Science](https://cse.umn.edu/cs) from the University of Minnesota. Before that, I received a B.S. in [Biomechatronics Engineering](https://www.bime.ntu.edu.tw/English/cp_n_100874.html) from National Taiwan University, advised by [Prof. Ta-Te Lin](https://ttlin.bime.ntu.edu.tw/team-%e5%9c%98%e9%9a%8a/).
