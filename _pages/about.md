I am a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science at the University of Minnesota](https://cse.umn.edu/cs), advised by [Prof. Volkan Isler](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isler/) in the [RSN lab](https://rsn.cs.utexas.edu/). My research interest is at the intersection of computer vision and robotics, focusing on problems related to 3D perception and scene understanding. Specifically, I have worked on projects involving novel view synthesis, camera pose estimation, 3D reconstruction and scene completion with generative AI. More recently, I worked on modeling dynamic objects. 


I hold a M.S. in [Computer Science](https://cse.umn.edu/cs) from the University of Minnesota and a B.S. in [Biomechatronics Engineering](https://www.bime.ntu.edu.tw/English/cp_n_100874.html) from National Taiwan University, where I was advised by [Prof. Ta-Te Lin](https://ttlin.bime.ntu.edu.tw/team-%e5%9c%98%e9%9a%8a/). In addition to academic work, I have interned at NVIDIA (2024), Samsung AI Center (2023), and Apple (2021).

Outside of research, I enjoy hiking, cooking, and playing volleyballâ€”if I find the time :grimacing:. I also enjoy "watching" video games, admiring the realistic experience brought by the most advanced physics and rendering engines. I look forward to the day when the digital world becomes indistinguishable from reality.
